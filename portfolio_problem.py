    Portfolio Optimization Problem.

    Given a set of stocks with known covariance (risk) matrix and expected returns,
    decide what proportion of a unit portfolio to invest in each stock so that:
      - The entire portfolio is invested (i.e., the proportions sum to 1),
      - The portfolio profit is at least the given expected profit,
      - And the portfolio risk (a quadratic function of the proportions) is minimized.
